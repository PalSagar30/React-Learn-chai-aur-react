# React-Learn
In this repository I am learning react from chai aur React 


Here I am learning react Day by Day approach. But In this time I am in tutorial hell. So I am trying to finish this as soon as possible.

## But now I realize that nothing can do very fast. So now I am trying to be better.



How I started 

1. Day-1: 15.01.2024
2. Day-2: 17.01.2024
3. Day-3: 20.01.2024
   
Now I update eveything and hopefully as I go on I try to learn in Daily based approached.


After revising necessary Javascript videos , Now i am start again ad Today is that day.

## Now I study in morning only react and evening revising my Javascript concepts

### In chai aur react playlist , almost 34 videos are available. So first 6 videos I already seen so I am tring to revise in Day-1. And after Day-1 I will one video a day and try to revise all previous  videos.
